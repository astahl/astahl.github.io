This blog will adhere to the following principles.

1. Get to the point in 100 words or less. Go!
2. No drafts: Either blog, or don't. There is no try.
3. No schedule.
4. No bears.
5. No comments.
6. And leave the important stuff to the professionals, for god's sake.

If these are ever violated, I will personally hold myself fully responsible to the extent of the law. Which law? *The* law.
